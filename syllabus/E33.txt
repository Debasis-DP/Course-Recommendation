Principle and Practice of Heat Treatment
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Course Content:
Section 1:
Introduction to Underlying Metallurgical Principles
	Definition of heat treatment: commonly heat treated ferrous and non ferrous metals
	Structural relationships: atoms, crystals, grains and macroscopic shape
	Metallurgy primer: metal crystal structures (BCC, FCC, HCP), strengthening mechanisms, role of defects, binary phase diagrams
	Mechanical properties: strength, hardness, ductility and toughness

Section 2:
Heat Treatment of Ferrous Metals
	Fe-Fe3C phase diagram-extended to TTT plot for eutectoid steel, effect of cooling rate on microstructural evolution
	TTT and CCT diagrams
	Common phases in steel: austenite, ferrite, pearlite, bainite and martensite
	Heat treatment regimes: conventional quench, martempering, austempering
	Hardenability concept – effect of section thickness and alloying

Section 3:
Heat Treatment of Non Ferrous Metals
	Aluminium alloys: alloy designation, focus on 2000 and 7000 series, typical heat treatments–aging transformations
	Magnesium alloys: common designation of casting grades, major alloy groups, heat treatment and microstructure/properties
	Titanium alloys: a, a + ß, ß alloys and typical heat treatments
	Nickel based superalloys: role of alloying elements, heat treatments & evolution of gamma prime

Section 4:
Thermochemical Treatments
	Definition of case hardening
	Carburising methods: solid, liquid, gas and plasma based processes
	Carburising procedure: continuous line layout, case depth vs process time, hardness & residual stress profiles
	Nitriding and nitrocarburising methods, line layout, pre and post oxidation treatments
	Properties of nitrided steel: hardness profiles, adhesive wear, fatigue and corrosion data
