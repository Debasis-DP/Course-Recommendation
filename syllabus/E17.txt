POST LIBERIZATION TRANSFORM IN INDIA:

Course Description: 
This course provides an introduction to the political economy of India. It examines the interplay of politics and economics in this large sub-continental country from

Some of the key themes to be explored are globalization, economic reform, poverty, redistribution, federalism, political protest, public goods delivery, gender, and ethnic politics.
