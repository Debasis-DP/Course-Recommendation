<br/><b>POST LIBERIZATION TRANSFORM IN INDIA:</b><br/>
<br/>
<br/><b>Course Description:</b><br/> 
<br/>This course provides an introduction to the political economy of India. It examines the interplay of politics and economics in this large sub-continental country from 
<br/>the village level to the international level. It begins by discussing India’s economy during the colonial period, looks at the challenges it has faced since independence, and then focuses on the transformations that have occurred since liberalization in the 1990s.  Some of the key themes to be explored are globalization, economic reform, poverty, redistribution, federalism, political protest, public goods delivery, gender, and ethnic politics.  Although this class focuses specifically on India, a number of the themes discussed in this course are central to an analysis of developing countries in general
