Chemical Kinetics
--------------------

UNIT-I 
Composite reactions: Opposing, parallel and consecutive reactions, concept of steady state and pre-equilibrium approximations, chain reactions.

UNIT-II 
Theories of predicting rate of chemical reaction, limitation of collision theory, transition state theory or TST (Van’t Hoff equation, Eyring equation)
Limitation of TST, Unimolecular Reactions. 

UNIT-III 
Potential energy surfaces (Polyani treatment), Saddle point theory, transient phase kinetics, Techniques to study fast reactions
Catalysis: homogeneous catalysis (acid/base catalyzed reaction), enzyme catalysis, Michaelis-Menten equation, inhibitors, heterogeneous
catalysis (gas/solid systems). Solution phase kinetics. 

UNIT-V 
Electrochemistry: Ionic interaction: DebyeHückel theory, mechanism of electrolytic conductance, Debye Huckel Onsager equation, Electrical conductance
mobility, concentration cell and transport numbers, conductometric and potentiometric titrations, Application of conductance and EMF measurements.
